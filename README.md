# Human-Anatomy-UnityAR Project

An Augmented Reality Application created in Unity Engine where a user can see a 3D  model of an organ after scanning it from camera.

## Main Menu
![main menu](https://github.com/Gulshan1357/Human-Anatomy-UnityAR/blob/main/Images%20and%20Gifs/1Organ%20Main.gif)
Users can select an organ using button (There are only two options, Heart and Lungs)
Users can scan organs using a camera (There are only two organs that can be scanned, Heart and Lungs)
Users can go to the settings menu and adjust the volume of background music
A quit button on the main menu closes the application.
A back button at every scene that takes the user back to the main menu
Looping background music which starts playing when the application is started. This music only plays during the Main Menu and Settings menu.

The Application is capable of scanning two organs Heart and Lungs.
A background sound that contains the basic information about the organ will start playing when the target image is detected.
The volume of the background image can be adjusted using the slider.
The 3D model of the detected organ can be rotated using the Rotate slider.
The 3D model of the detected organ can be scaled using the Scale slider.


## Heart Screen
![Heart menu](https://github.com/Gulshan1357/Human-Anatomy-UnityAR/blob/main/Images%20and%20Gifs/3Organ%20Heart.gif)
Users can choose to view the heart by clicking on the Heart button in the main menu.
The Background sound will only start playing when the marker is detected and will stop when the marker is removed. The background sound is a text-to-speech WAV file describing the basic functionality of the heart.
The sound can be adjusted using the Volume slider.
This screen will show a 3D model of the heart along with 3D text pointing out the various parts of the heart.
The 3D model of the heart can be rotated using the Rotate slider.
The 3D model of the heart can be scaled using the Scale slider.

## Lungs Screen
![Lungs menu](https://github.com/Gulshan1357/Human-Anatomy-UnityAR/blob/main/Images%20and%20Gifs/4Organ%20Lungs.gif)

This screen will show a 3D model of the lungs along with 3D text pointing out the various parts of the lungs.
The 3D model of lungs can be rotated using the Rotate slider.
The 3D model of lungs can be scaled using the Scale slider.
